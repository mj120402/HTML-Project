        <br>
    <div class="anime">
        <h3><a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/MURlKAMl">ANIME!!!</a></h3>
            <p>Yes yes, you guys probably expected this but I like anime.</br> Watched it as a child with titles such as Pokemon and Dragon Ball Z and grew such a liking to it that I love it to this day.</br>It sort of grew into me as a child and now I sort of still like it</p>

    <div class="games">
        <h3>GAMES</h3>
            <p>Another thing I love is games.</br> Ever since a child, I was always excited to get home and play games for hours and hours, even to this day I still do, not as much as back then but you get the point.</br> Playing games has become the main hobby I enjoy doing since there is a multitude of games to choose for specific genres.</br>One of the first games I played was called Sonic Heroes on the PlayStation 2. And to this day, I still love playing games.</br> `
